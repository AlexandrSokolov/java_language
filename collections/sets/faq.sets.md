### SequencedSet and NavigableSet

A SequencedSet is an externally or internally ordered Set that also exposes the methods of SequencedCollection. 
A NavigableSet is an internally ordered SequencedSet that therefore also automatically sorts its elements, 
and provides additional methods to find elements adjacent to a target value.
